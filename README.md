SilverPlatter Examples
======================

### Note:
All the files will need a line like `$:.unshift File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../lib'` in the top of them so that they work without installing the gems. Not installing the gems and instead checking out the repos mean that you get the changes far more quickly. 
Or, you can set RUBYLIB to point to the location of the silverplatter-irc and silverplatter-log folders you've checked out.
